# reduction - CUDA Parallel Reduction

## Description

A parallel sum reduction that computes the sum of a large arrays of values. This sample demonstrates several important optimization strategies for Data-Parallel Algorithms like reduction using shared memory, __shfl_down_sync, __reduce_add_sync and cooperative_groups reduce.

## Key Concepts

Data-Parallel Algorithms, Performance Strategies, Warp Reduce Functions
