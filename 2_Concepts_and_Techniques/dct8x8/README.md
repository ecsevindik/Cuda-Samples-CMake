# dct8x8 - DCT8x8

## Description

This sample demonstrates how Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for blocks of 8 by 8 pixels can be performed using CUDA: a naive implementation by definition and a more traditional approach used in many libraries. As opposed to implementing DCT in a fragment shader, CUDA allows for an easier and more efficient implementation.

## Key Concepts

Image Processing, Video Compression
