### cudaMallocManaged
    __host__ â€‹cudaError_t cudaMallocManaged ( void** devPtr, size_t size, unsigned int  flags = cudaMemAttachGlobal )
    Allocates memory that will be automatically managed by the Unified Memory system.
    Parameters

    devPtr
        - Pointer to allocated device memory 
    size
        - Requested allocation size in bytes 
    flags
        - Must be either cudaMemAttachGlobal or cudaMemAttachHost (defaults to cudaMemAttachGlobal) 

    Returns

    cudaSuccess, cudaErrorMemoryAllocation, cudaErrorNotSupported, cudaErrorInvalidValue
    Description

    Allocates size bytes of managed memory on the device and returns in *devPtr a pointer to the allocated memory. If the device doesn't support allocating managed memory, cudaErrorNotSupported is returned. Support for managed memory can be queried using the device attribute cudaDevAttrManagedMemory. The allocated memory is suitably aligned for any kind of variable. The memory is not cleared. If size is 0, cudaMallocManaged returns cudaErrorInvalidValue. The pointer is valid on the CPU and on all GPUs in the system that support managed memory. All accesses to this pointer must obey the Unified Memory programming model.

    flags specifies the default stream association for this allocation. flags must be one of cudaMemAttachGlobal or cudaMemAttachHost. The default value for flags is cudaMemAttachGlobal. If cudaMemAttachGlobal is specified, then this memory is accessible from any stream on any device. If cudaMemAttachHost is specified, then the allocation should not be accessed from devices that have a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess; an explicit call to cudaStreamAttachMemAsync will be required to enable access on such devices.

    If the association is later changed via cudaStreamAttachMemAsync to a single stream, the default association, as specifed during cudaMallocManaged, is restored when that stream is destroyed. For __managed__ variables, the default association is always cudaMemAttachGlobal. Note that destroying a stream is an asynchronous operation, and as a result, the change to default association won't happen until all work in the stream has completed.

    Memory allocated with cudaMallocManaged should be released with cudaFree.

    Device memory oversubscription is possible for GPUs that have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess. Managed memory on such GPUs may be evicted from device memory to host memory at any time by the Unified Memory driver in order to make room for other allocations.

    In a multi-GPU system where all GPUs have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess, managed memory may not be populated when this API returns and instead may be populated on access. In such systems, managed memory can migrate to any processor's memory at any time. The Unified Memory driver will employ heuristics to maintain data locality and prevent excessive page faults to the extent possible. The application can also guide the driver about memory usage patterns via cudaMemAdvise. The application can also explicitly migrate memory to a desired processor's memory via cudaMemPrefetchAsync.

    In a multi-GPU system where all of the GPUs have a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess and all the GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other, the physical storage for managed memory is created on the GPU which is active at the time cudaMallocManaged is called. All other GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth via peer mappings over the PCIe bus. The Unified Memory driver does not migrate memory among such GPUs.

    In a multi-GPU system where not all GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other and where the value of the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess is zero for at least one of those GPUs, the location chosen for physical storage of managed memory is system-dependent.

        On Linux, the location chosen will be device memory as long as the current set of active contexts are on devices that either have peer-to-peer support with each other or have a non-zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess. If there is an active context on a GPU that does not have a non-zero value for that device attribute and it does not have peer-to-peer support with the other devices that have active contexts on them, then the location for physical storage will be 'zero-copy' or host memory. Note that this means that managed memory that is located in device memory is migrated to host memory if a new context is created on a GPU that doesn't have a non-zero value for the device attribute and does not support peer-to-peer with at least one of the other devices that has an active context. This in turn implies that context creation may fail if there is insufficient host memory to migrate all managed allocations.

        On Windows, the physical storage is always created in 'zero-copy' or host memory. All GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth over the PCIe bus. In these circumstances, use of the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is recommended to restrict CUDA to only use those GPUs that have peer-to-peer support. Alternatively, users can also set CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC to a non-zero value to force the driver to always use device memory for physical storage. When this environment variable is set to a non-zero value, all devices used in that process that support managed memory have to be peer-to-peer compatible with each other. The error cudaErrorInvalidDevice will be returned if a device that supports managed memory is used and it is not peer-to-peer compatible with any of the other managed memory supporting devices that were previously used in that process, even if cudaDeviceReset has been called on those devices. These environment variables are described in the CUDA programming guide under the "CUDA environment variables" section.

    Note:

        Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

        Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

        Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.
