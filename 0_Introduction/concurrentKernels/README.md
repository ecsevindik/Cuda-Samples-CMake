# concurrentKernels - Concurrent Kernels

## Description

This sample demonstrates the use of CUDA streams for concurrent execution of several kernels on GPU device. It also illustrates how to introduce dependencies between CUDA streams with the new cudaStreamWaitEvent function.

## Key Concepts

Performance Strategies, cudaStreamWaitEvent, Cooperative Groups - Thread Block Example,
