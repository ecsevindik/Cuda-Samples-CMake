### __umul24
    __device__ â€‹ unsigned int __umul24 ( unsigned int  x, unsigned int  y )
    Calculate the least significant 32 bits of the product of the least significant 24 bits of two unsigned integers.
    Returns

    Returns the least significant 32 bits of the product x * y.
    Description

    Calculate the least significant 32 bits of the product of the least significant 24 bits of x and y. The high order 8 bits of x and y are ignored.
