# simpleAtomicIntrinsics_nvrtc - Simple Atomic Intrinsics with libNVRTC

## Description

A simple demonstration of global memory atomic instructions.This sample makes use of NVRTC for Runtime Compilation.

## Key Concepts

Atomic Intrinsics, Runtime Compilation

## Interesting Phonemena
While running kernel in simpleAtomicIntrinsics example takes 52 ms, this example having same kernel, launched with same parameters, takes 0.2 ms.
